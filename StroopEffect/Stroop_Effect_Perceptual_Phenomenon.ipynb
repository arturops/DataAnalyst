    "The Stroop effect[[1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-OkpZLjG_kX9J6LIQ5IltsqMzVWjh36QpnP2RYpVdPU/pub?embedded=True)] is a psycological phenomenon shown in human reaction to relate concepts (words) to vision (images, colors). In order to understand such relation of concepts and images, psycologists test a participant with two lists of words, which display words in different color of ink. The participant's task is to say the color of the ink of the word shown.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The task has two scenarios with equally-size lists of words: \n",
    "1. **Congruent** words:\n",
    "Shown words are colored matching the colors in which they are displayed. _Example: <font color=\"red\">RED</font>, <font color=\"blue\">BLUE</font>._\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "2. **Incongruent** words: \n",
    "Shown words are colored, but this time the color of words does not match the word. Thus, the name of incongruent. _Example: <font color=\"orange\">PURPLE</font>, <font color=\"purple\">ORANGE</font>._\n",

We want to look at the reaction time of people in both scenarios and make conclusions on participants' reactions. Therefore, we will compare the reaction time of **Congruent** and **Incongruent** scenarios. Since we need a sample size to run to make a hypothesis test, we will need to consider the average of our times congruent and incongruent to be our parameters for the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the hypothesis, the traditional thinking believes that the participants' reaction time is the same or maybe even slower when they have congruent words. However, we want to challenge that idea by saying that we believe the participants' have a faster reaction time when color and words match (congruent) than when color and words do not match (incongruent).

    "The histogram and boxplot clearly show the incongruent group has two outliers that are shifting the mean to the right skewing the distribution to the right. The boxplot also shows that most of the samples in the incongruent group actually live between the 25% and 75% percentile, which is a good indication that the distribution is normal.\n",
    "The congruent group on the other hand has its mean centered on the highest frequency of the histogram which is as close as the mode and median it can get to indicate a normal distribution. On the box plot, however, we can notice the spread between the minimum and maximum values in the congruent group is larger than the incongruent group. This was not expected as our variance for the congruent group was smaller, but this might be an indicative that if we remove the ouliers from the incongruent group (consecuentively from the congruent group as well) we should find a smaller variance for the incongruent distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while removing outliers in one group, we might find there will be an outlier for the other group. This all will depend on our metric to remove outliers. In here, we will consider the boxplot out tool to determine of something is an outlier."

    "The null hypothesis ($H_0$) of our problem is that the reaction time of participants in the Stroop test was greater or equal for congruent words (words colored as their label, e.g. <font color='green'>GREEN</font>, <font color='blue'>BLUE</font>) than for incongruent words (words colored different than their label, e.g. <font color='red'>GREEN</font>, <font color='cyan'>PINK</font>). However, we challenged this idea proposing an alternative hypothesis saying that the reaction time for congruent words was faster than for incongruent words. During our hypothesis test, we decided to choose a confidence level of 99.5% resulting in a type I error threshold of $\\alpha = 0.005$. After our hypothesis test using bootstrapping and t-test one-tail test with unequal variance we got a $pvalue < \\alpha$. Since the pvalue was smaller than $\\alpha$ we got enough information to reject $H_0$ and conclude that based on our test we have more than 99.5% confidence that the participants have a faster reaction time when going through all the congruent words than when doing the same for incongruent words. This is in fact something we expected because we believed that having color not matching the words make us think more about what we see and what it means. We believe we will need to think more before speaking when looking at incongruent words. In other words, the Stroop effect is indeed interferes people’s reaction time on a task when reading incogruent words."
